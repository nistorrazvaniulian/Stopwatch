## Introduction

Welcome to the Stopwatch Project! This project provides a basic stopwatch interface allowing users to start, stop, and reset the timer. It's a great example for beginners learning JavaScript and working with simple web applications.

## Features

- Start, stop, and reset functionality.
- Accurate time tracking down to milliseconds.
- Clear and intuitive user interface.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Use the "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons to control the stopwatch.

## How it Works

The stopwatch is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how each button functions:

- **Start:** Initiates the stopwatch, tracking time from zero.
- **Stop:** Pauses the stopwatch, allowing you to resume from where you left off.
- **Reset:** Resets the stopwatch to zero, clearing all recorded time.

The display is updated in real-time to show hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

Feel free to explore the code in `script.js` for a deeper understanding of the implementation.
